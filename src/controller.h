// An RpcController mediates a single method call.  The primary purpose of
// the controller is to provide a way to manipulate settings specific to the
// RPC implementation and to find out about RPC-level errors.
//
// The methods provided by the RpcController interface are intended to be a
// "least common denominator" set of features which we expect all
// implementations to support.  Specific implementations may provide more
// advanced features (e.g. deadline propagation).
//
// This introduce from project of protobuf.

		// will indicate that the call failed at that time.
